### 1. Data Collection with Web Scraping

Web scrap Falcon 9 launch records with BeautifulSoup:

Extract a Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia
Parse the table and convert it into a Pandas data frame



### 2. Data Collection API

In this lab, you will make a get request to the SpaceX API. You will also do some basic data wrangling and formating.

Request to the SpaceX API
Clean the requested data
